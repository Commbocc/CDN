It&rsquo;s time to CHECK us out – after all, we want to be transparent and accountable for the dollars we spend. We are introducing the first release of our “Online Checkbook Register” to provide access to information related to Hillsborough County&rsquo;s spending.

In this first release, spending can be viewed by:

* Capital Improvements Projects
* Vendor & Agencies Spending
* Departments

Developed in partnership with [Hillsborough County&rsquo;s Comptroller & Clerk of the Circuit Court](https://www.hillsclerk.com/publicweb/home.aspx), the custodian of all County records and funds, Hillsborough County government will ensure the public is able to view how funds are disbursed and spent.

It is important to keep in mind that in collaboration with the Clerk&rsquo;s Office we will continue to make enhancements and provide access to more information as we continue to build and enhance the features of this Checkbook Register.

Information from independent County agencies such as the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, Tax Collector, Supervisor of Elections, and Property Appraiser will not be included.

For questions or additional information, please contact us through the [Customer Service Center](https://service.hillsboroughcounty.org/311).
