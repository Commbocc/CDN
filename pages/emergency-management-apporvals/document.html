	This Continuity of Operations Plan (Plan) was prepared by <strong class="the_department">the Department</strong> to develop, implement and maintain a viable continuity capability. This Plan complies with applicable internal department policy, County policy, local and state regulations, and supports recommendations provided in the Federal Continuity Guidance Circular 1 (CGC1), National Fire Protection Association Standard on Disaster/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs (NFPA 1600), Emergency Management Accreditation Program (EMAP), and industry accepted "best practices".
</p>

<p>
	This Plan has been distributed internally within <strong class="the_department">the Department</strong> and to other departments and agencies that might be affected by its implementation.

<p>
	This Plan shall be reviewed annually.
