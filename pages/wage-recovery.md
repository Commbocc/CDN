	Suffering unpaid or unfair wages at work?<br>
	<small>If you earned it, you deserve it.</small>
</h1>

"Wage theft" is when an employer fails to compensate an employee the full amount they earned. Common scenarios include incorrectly calculated overtime and failure to pay for time worked just before an employee puts in notice (or employment is terminated).

Hillsborough County is here to help you recover any wages you are entitled to. You may qualify for this help if you meet the conditions below:

* You are an employee or independent contractor who has performed work in Hillsborough County
* You believe your employer failed to pay or underpaid the appropriate wage for your work

If you believe you qualify, call Hillsborough County Consumer Protection Agency at 813-903-3430 for more information.


### Hillsborough County Wage Recovery Ordinance

Based upon reports and documentation provided to the County Commission, a new [ordinance](http://hillsboroughcounty.org/Admin/DocumentCenter/Document/View/17812) was created that goes into effect in January of 2016. This new ordinance is designed to respond to the nonpayment of earned wages of citizens working in Hillsborough County. Its purpose is to promote business and economic development by working to eliminate unfair competition by businesses who would deliberately not pay or underpay their employees. In situations where this has occurred, employees can suffer economic losses due to their failure to pay rent, or other bills, and many may be forced to rely on public assistance to meet their basic needs. Several entities will be working on this effort, including Hillsborough County Consumer Protection, the 13th Judicial Circuit Mediation and Diversion Services, Bay Area Legal Services and Code Enforcement.

So, you feel you have been underpaid or had wages withheld unfairly? Now What?

**First, consider if you qualify.**

Are you an employee or independent contractor who has a dispute about wages due to performing work physically within Hillsborough County while being employed by an employer?

Has your dispute arisen within the last 14 calendar days, or at most 14 calendar days from the date work was performed?

* This is the normal pay period, and is what is considered "reasonable time" to bring a wage claim under the ordinance. If you are paid in other pay periods, those other pay schedules apply here.

Are you disputing at least $60.00 or more?

* The minimum amount you can claim is $60.00 under the ordinance.

**If you answered 'Yes' to the above questions, you likely qualify for assistance.**

What are wages?

* Wages, under the ordinance, means any form of monetary compensation that an employee or independent contractor agreed to accept for performing work or providing services for the employer. If these are salary, daily, hourly, by piece, applicable overtime pay, or by written or verbal contractual agreement, whether exempt or non-exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), or other federal, state, or local wage laws. In no case shall the wage rate be less than the minimum wage rate established by operation of federal, state or local law, whichever is higher.

### Wage Recovery Process

A claim is filed with the 13th Judicial Mediation and Diversions Services Program.

* Mediation begins and a notice is sent to the Employer.
* Mediation is either successful and wages are recovered, or it is unsuccessful.
* If mediation is unsuccessful, the matter is referred to Bay Area Legal or private legal counsel.

Bay Area Legal (or private counsel) begins their case consultation.

* Client may decide to:
  * terminate the claim,
  * proceed in civil court, or
  * go to an administrative hearing
* Client may be represented by Bay Area Legal if the qualify for services.
* The claim could be resolved prior to court, or through court, with a ruling enforceable by the court if that is the outcome.

An Administrative Hearing may be called through the Code Enforcement Board

* Once a hearing is scheduled and occurs, a ruling will be made for the employee or the employer.
* A ruling for the employee may result in:
  * wage recovery,
  * wages plus damages (up to 2X the amount originally withheld),
  * the employer paying administrative costs,
  * the order being dismissed if the employee failed to prove the claim, or
  * the employee paying administrative costs if the claim was found to have been filed unjustly, in retaliation, or harassment purposes.
