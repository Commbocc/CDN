title: Online Dating Or Sweetheart Scams
---

Warning signs that someone might be a scam artist:

* Claims feelings of love early on
* Wants to leave the dating site immediately and use personal email or messaging services
* Claims to be from the United States but currently overseas or serving in the military
* Plans to visit, but unable to do so because of a tragic event
* Makes multiple requests and is persistent in asking for money

What you can do about it:

* Beware of pursuing long-distance relationships with strangers online or over the telephone, and when you meet, do so in public.
* Do not wire money for any reason, including for travel, medical emergencies, hotel bills, or losses from a financial setback.
* Never reveal personal or financial information.
* Stick to paid online dating sites, but do not assume these sites are free of predators.
* Many scammers use a photo they've swiped from a social media page. Use [TinEye.com](http://TinEye.com) to find out where on the Internet the photo has appeared.
* Create secure passwords. Scammers have ways of accessing unsecured profiles and photos.
