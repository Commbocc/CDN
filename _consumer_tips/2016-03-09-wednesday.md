Are you searching for affordable housing? If so, beware of Section 8 housing assistance scams that prey on homebuyers. This scam leads home-seekers to fake websites that look like registration sites for Section 8 waiting list lotteries, evening using an Equal Housing Opportunity logo in an attempt to collect fees and personal information from unsuspecting victims.  The Florida Trade Commission (FTC) warns consumers not to sign up for the waitlist, enter personal information, or pay a registration fee, if the site asks for one. The fee goes straight to the scammers' bank accounts, and the online form gives them access to your identity.

In addition, some of the fake sites will list Section 8 properties that are available for rent, requiring you to pay the first month's rent via a wire transfer or a prepaid card. According to the FTC, these properties may exist, but you could lose your money and personal information to scammers.

There is no fee to register for a real Section 8 waiting list. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 8 program provides funding to local government housing authorities. The local authorities issue housing choice vouchers to help people find housing in privately-owned rental units.

To get on the waiting list for a voucher, contact your local housing authority at [www.thafl.com](http://www.thafl.com) or contact Hillsborough County Consumer Protection at 813-903-3430 for more information.
