		In the next 25 years, more than 1.8 million people will call Hillsborough County home. As it stands, today's transportation system is struggling to keep up with current demands and current financial resources are already committed. In order to compete for jobs with other communities of our size, we need to invest in transportation and mobility solutions that encourage and help build a vibrant quality of life.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Transportation for Economic Development (TED) initiative is led by all seven County Commissioners, the Mayors of Tampa, Temple Terrace and Plant City, as well as the Chairman of the HART board. Over the past year, they've met with transportation and economic development experts about important transportation issues and transportation needs to build a strong environment to enhance our ability to attract new jobs to Hillsborough County. The leaders are working on solutions to connect residents and visitors to places they want to go.
