Dr. Christopher J. \"Chris\" Card is Chief Operating Officer for Lutheran Services Florida.

Card came to LSF in December 2012 after serving as the South Region Vice President for Providence Services Corporation responsible for a wide range of social service programs throughout Florida, Texas and Louisiana.  

Card has extensive experience in many arenas of social services including five years as a child welfare case manager and supervisor in Houston, Texas, five years managing an inpatient treatment center for children and adolescents, five years as a statewide advocate and association director for the Florida Network of Youth and Family Services, and nearly a decade as a Community Based Care lead agency executive director.

Card was a founder of Florida\'s child welfare reform called Community Based Care and has been appointed by Governors Lawton Chiles and Jeb Bush to a variety of positions of state leadership for children and families. Card was the primary architect and advocate for the system of care that has reformed Florida\'s child welfare system. Card was the first executive of the pilot project in Sarasota County Florida that has been duplicated throughout the entire state of Florida. This reform included systemic redesign, data system development and implementation, transition from a state service delivery system to a community service delivery system, and significant policy and procedure reform. This reform has resulted in dramatic improvement in performance for all child welfare services including tripling the number of adoptions each year, a 40 percent reduction in the children in out of home care placements, over 25 percent reduction in caseloads, along with many other accomplishments.  

Card holds a Bachelor\'s Degree in Economics from Oakland University. He received his Masters in Social Work from Wayne State University and his Doctorate of Social Work at the University of South Florida.
