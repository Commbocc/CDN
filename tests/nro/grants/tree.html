	<h4>Program Purpose</h4>
	<p>
		The purpose of this matching grant program is to encourage the planting of trees within public or private common areas exposed to the community population. The Board of County Commissioners recognizes that the planting of trees proves invaluable to the overall welfare of our communities. Trees provide numerous environmental benefits such as oxygen production, air pollution control, noise abatement, rainfall dispersion to control flooding and aesthetic and wildlife enhancement. For these reasons and many more valuable attributes, this program encourages the planting of trees in community-maintained areas and road rights of way within or adjacent to the neighborhood. 
	</p>

	<h4>Projects for Consideration</h4>
