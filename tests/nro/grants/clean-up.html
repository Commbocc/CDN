	<h4>Program Purpose</h4>
	<p>
		The broad purpose of the program is to involve citizens in their community upkeep, retain property 
		values within neighborhoods, and reduce factors that contribute to crime. The specific purpose of this 
		program is to encourage members of neighborhood associations to conduct clean-up projects in their 
		own community, which can include litter pick up, yard waste, appliances, metal, furniture, and wood 
		for deposit in roll-off containers. 
	</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Projects For Consideration</h4>
	<p>
		Neighborhood leaders are invited to propose projects that will clean up the area within their 
		boundaries which have become littered or unsightly, and provide residents an opportunity to dispose 
		of large household items not eligible for normal trash pick-up. Labor must be provided by 
		neighborhood residents as an in-kind contribution to the proposed project. No pond clean-up 
		applications will be approved under this program. 
	</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Who Can Apply</h4>

		Neighborhood, Civic, Homeowner Associations, Crime Watch Programs and Special Taxing Districts 
		in Unincorporated Hillsborough County are eligible to apply. A specific area that the applicant 
		represents must be identified and evidence of active local resident involvement and concurrence will 
		be required. For-profit service providers and local government entitles are not eligible to apply.

	<p>
		Complete this application. Read each question carefully and respond in the 
		spaces provided. Contact the Office of Neighborhood Relations 813-272-5860 if you have any 
		questions. Please allow a minimum of 30 days between submission of your application and the

	</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Additional Information</h4>
	<p>
		Waste Removal - The association will be responsible for providing Neighborhood Relations 30 days prior notice of the date that a clean-up will be held. The County has a contract with Republic Services, Inc. to provide a maximum of five 30-yard roll-off containers on any given Saturday, with only One (1) clean-up per Saturday. When the date has been established, the Neighborhood Relations Liaison will coordinate with Hillsborough County Public Utilities Department. The Hillsborough County Public Utilities Department will be responsible for contacting Republic Services, Inc., directly for the roll-off containers (dumpsters) to be delivered to the physical location identified by the association. Associations are not to pay the company directly. Payments for roll-offs will be made by the Public Utilities Department to the company.
	</p>

	<p>
		All items must be separated by type and placed into separate roll-offs. Yard waste can be disposed of if a separate container is ordered for them. Appliances (also known as white goods) and other Clean-up Grant - FY 2015 metal items should go in one roll-off. Appliances containing Freon should either be in a separate container, or grouped in one area of the appliance container. 
	</p>

	<strong>What will be accepted at the roll-offs:</strong>
	<ul>

		<li>Old refrigerators, ovens, water heaters, steel and other metals, old furniture (such as couches, chairs, tables and mattresses), construction debris (such as concrete, bricks, glass and roofing materials), and tires. </li>

		<li>No items normally picked up at the curb by Hillsborough County (household trash), solid waste from commercial activity, or hazardous waste such as paint, household chemicals, batteries and propane tanks. </li>

		<li>NO PROFESSIONAL SERVICES OR SUB-CONTRACTORS, STRICTLY FOR HOMEOWNERS. </li>

		<li>If depositing yard waste, that waste must be placed in a separate roll-off container. The waste cannot be in plastic bags, because the bags are not processable. All bags containing leaves, tree cuttings, twigs, etc., must be emptied into the RO and the bags kept by the residents and placed in their regular household garbage container for collection. </li>

		<li>Since the County's disposal sites will not accept yard waste ROs with bags, you need to ensure that all participants are aware of this process. Otherwise, pick-up of the roll-off will be refused or it will be returned to the neighborhood for sorting and removal of the bags, making a lot of extra work for everyone. </li>

		<li>All tires must be placed in the same roll-off(s). </li>

		<li>No televisions, microwaves, computers or radios are allowed in the roll-off containers. </li>
	</ul>
	<br>

	</p>

	<p>
		The Public Utilities Department is responsible for ordering the roll-off containers directly from Republic Services, Inc. 
	</p>

	<p>
