		Hillsborough County uses various means to notify the public of upcoming Public Hearings and recognizes that neighborhoods and civic associations want to participate in planning and development issues such as:</p>
		<p>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Requests for rezoning</li>
			<li>Minor and Major Modifications to existing Planned Development zoning districts and Special Use Permits</li>
			<li>Special Use Permit requests for items such as liquor stores and solid waste (trash) facilities</li>
		</ul>
		<p><br />
		</p>
		<p>
			To provide neighborhood groups with a greater opportunity to participate in the decisions which affect their residents, the Board of County Commissioners approved procedures that interested neighborhoods within one mile of a proposed development activity be notified. Notices concerning applications and dates for public hearings are sent by mail.
		</p>
		<p>
			Organizations which represent a geographic area of no less than 50 households, and which actually represent 50 percent of those households (no less than 25 households) may <a href="http://www.hillsboroughcounty.org/DocumentCenter/Home/View/3484" target="_self" title="Instructions for registering" class="Hyperlink">register for these zoning notifications</a>.
