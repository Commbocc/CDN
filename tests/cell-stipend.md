Please be advised that the county is in the process of transitioning from the cellular stipend program to providing county-issued cellphones. The county will no longer be offering the County Cellular Stipend Program for county employees beginning March 14, 2016.  County staff who are currently participants within the County Stipend Program and are receiving a stipend will be transitioned off the program prior to the end of this fiscal year, September 30, 2016.  

Department directors will determine who within their department is provided a county issued telephone. Funding of the county issued cell phone will be the responsibility of the approving department.

The transition from the County Cellular Stipend Program to county issued cell phones is to ensure the county is properly capturing communications on mobile devices to comply with Florida statutes for public records retention.
