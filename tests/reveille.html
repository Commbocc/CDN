				As an on-going effort to answer the national call to end Veteran homelessness by 2015, the Tampa-Hillsborough County Continuum of Care (CoC), as part of the 25 Cities Initiative and the Mayor's Challenge to end Veteran homelessness, is working diligently to bring our community to "Functional Zero". This multi-sector collaboration will incorporate federal, regional, state and local government agencies, faith-based organizations, housing providers, non-profit agencies and businesses to connect 50 homeless Veterans to permanent or permanent supportive housing on that day. Other services, such as intensive case management, employment services, legal assistance, mental health services, benefits eligibility screenings, Veterans benefits, financial counseling, health care, and household supplies will also be provided.
