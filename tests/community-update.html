						<h2>Sandy’s approach to transportation funding</h2>
						I am in favor of an alternative approach that will give our community a substantial increase of transportation funding for Hillsborough County roads. The county commission can achieve this by adopting three specific measures this year that would raise at least $72 million annually, none of which require voter approval of a general tax on themselves. First, I support prioritizing our existing budgets to fund new transportation investments. I support creating a transportation trust fund by allocating a percentage of all new property and sales tax revenue each year to fund transportation road work and maintenance. I also support two separate user fees — development fees, commonly referred to as mobility fees, and gas taxes — to help pay for transportation investments.

						<h1>Does Your Child Need Health and Dental Insurance?</h1>

						<p>
							Through Florida KidCare, the state of Florida offers health insurance for children from birth through the end of age 18, even if one or both parents are working. When families apply for the insurance, they are assigned to the appropriate Florida KidCare program based on age and family income:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>MediKids (subsidized and full-pay): 1-4 years</li>
							<li>Florida Healthy Kids (subsidized and full-pay): 5-18 years</li>
							<li>Children’s Medical Services (CMS): birth-18 years, with special health care needs</li>
							<li>Medicaid: age-based eligibility tied to Federal Poverty Level</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							All Florida KidCare programs, including Florida Healthy Kids, cover doctor visits, checkups, immunizations, surgeries, prescriptions, emergencies, dental care and more.
						</p>

						<p>
							Many Florida KidCare families pay as little as $15 a month – and many other families pay nothing at all. Families that do not qualify for subsidized coverage can still utilize the full-pay option.
